# DnD-Character-Generator

This is a character generator using neural networks for accuracy. I will be including all (sub)races and (sub)classes in the official 5e books. This uses a modified neural network model to generate accurate, canon-friendly names for each race and gender.

Please feel free to use anything here in your own projects or games and feel free to make edits for your own homebrew. I only ask for credit where due. Also feel free to make requests through the Issues tab.

Currently includes forked code from https://github.com/bvezilic/DnD-name-generator that was modified for usage here.
