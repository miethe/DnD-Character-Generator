# DnD-Character-Generator

This repo is going to be a web-hosted character generator. I will be including all (sub)races and (sub)classes in the official 5e books. This will be using a modified neural network to generate accurate, canon-friendly names. More features will be continously added as long as I keep coming up with them.

Please feel free to use anything here in your own projects or games and feel free to make edits for your own homebrew. I only ask for credit where due. Also feel free to make requests through the Issues tab.
